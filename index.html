			<b> Abstract </b>
		</p>	

		<p>
		This GPU Ray tracer project seeks to address the bottleneck introduced by an image with a large amount of pixels and a high number of samples taken at each pixel.  A large number of jittered samples per pixel is desired for anti-aliasing, but the render time for the image slows down by a factor of the number of samples when samples are computed in a serial manner.  
		</p>

		<p>
		The base code for this project was taken from a Javascript serial ray tracer project that I worked on during Fall 2015.  Special thanks to Jakub Kowalik for pair programming to refactor the code from Javascript to C.  I implemented the parallelization design and conversion of the serial ray tracer into a parallelized ray tracer in C.
		</p>

		<p>
		In this project, I address parallelizing the pixel sampling process.  Each pixel is assigned to a thread, so one thread computes all the samples for only a single pixel.  I use CUDA to access the an NVIDIA GPU.  The grid is created with the same dimensions as the desired image size, and the kernel assigns each thread to a pixel, based on the thread's row and column.  Scene information is loaded onto each thread in this parallelization approach.  Each thread safely writes the computed color into a globally shared array, which is sent to the host to be reassembled as an image.

			<b> Compilation Details </b>
		</p>

		<p>
		This code compiles on MacOSX and assumes access to an NVIDIA GPU.  The Cairo image library must also be installed for png generation.
